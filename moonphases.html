                            The first moon phase of a new moon cycle.
                            Between the earth and the sun, the new moon finds its place and because of that we are not
                            able to see her, but we can feel her strong energy.
                            This moon phase marks a time of renewal and is a great time to let go of old feelings and
                            emotions and make new plans, projects and wishes.
                            It’s also a good phase to do detox.
                            Not a very good time for consuming alcohol, caffeine and nicotine.</p>

                            darkness.
                            This is the moon phase that stands for courage and faith and it is the phase where you can
                            clearly express your wishes, so take action. It is also a good time to work on your
                            relationship, work, study and health. Now is a good time to do sports, but not to lose
                            weight.
                            In this period, you can feel the increasing moon energy, it can take effect in your dreams.

                            The first quarter moon is also known as half-moon. This moon phase is a good time to make
                            decisions, it is also the time that resistance can come. If you made plans, projects or
                            wishes during the new moon it can be that doubts arise, it is important to look over your
                            intentions and don’t be discouraged. Make a to-do list of what you need to do to reach your
                            goals (plans/projects/wished) and remove the obstacles you encountered.

                            The waxing gibbous moon is the phase to refine your intentions. If things don’t seem to work
                            out as you planned, adjust them. Sometimes the universe will give you small hints for
                            example in your dreams. Sit down and be aware of those chances, be grateful for them.
                            Consider what you yourself can do to bring yourself closer to your set intentions, add
                            things to the to-do list you made. It is the time to keep faith, meditation can help with
                            that.
                            Emotions will grow more intense during this moon phase.

                            With the full moon, the moon and the sun stand on opposite sides of the earth. It is a phase
                            of plentitude and in this phase the moon energy is on its peak. That’s why a lot of people
                            have sleep problems around this time of the moon cycle.
                            It is the time to harvest and an excellent time to socialize, make love, get pregnant and to
                            push yourself to achieve your goals. As said, this is not the best time for sleep due to the
                            moon energy which can peak emotions.

                            The moonlight in this phase is also great to load gemstones with energy the
                            moonlight brings. Oligoclase is the perfect gemstone for the full moon period, it cheers you
                            up and it helps you to cope with the intense emotions of this moon phase.

                            Best not to start new projects in this part of the moon cycle, but let bad habits, bad
                            thoughts, bad relationships and negative energy go. Forgive yourself and others!
                            So, a cleanse is a great way to prepare yourself to the coming moon cycle and another new
