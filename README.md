Follow the moon is a fictional site about living with the flow of the moon that I set up as my first milestone project. The focus with this site is to combine what I learned in a previous course about the moon with what I learned this far about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The site’s goal is to share information, tips and tricks about living with the flow of the moon.

Demo

UX
======
It will be a B2C site which targets audience interested in moonology / yoga / spirituality.

User stories

**Visitor Goals**
* Learn more about the influence the moon has on daily life.
* Find out on which day of the moon cycle we are today.
* Learn what to do and what not to do in the present moon phase.
* Follow fitting meditations.

**Site Owners Goals**
* Provide information about moonology, influence of the moon on daily life.
* Share passion for the moon / yoga / spirituality.

**Strategy**

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can get to the wanted information as quickly as possible.

**Scope**

The site will contain a printable moon cycle calendar and information about do’s and don’ts during each moon phase, influence of the moon on daily life and fitting meditations with different moon phases. In later sprints things as a Spotify playlist, a moon cycle period tracker and a personal journey for goals settings can be added.

**Structure**

This site will be structured as clear as possible, to get the wanted information as quickly as possible. The navigation bar will be visible at the left top side to easily navigate to other subjects. It ensures that the user knows what to do and what to expect.

**Skeleton**

!!!!Place wireframe or wireframe links here!!!!!

**Surface**

The colors in the color pallet I got by using the homepage image and uploading it to https://colordesigner.io/color-palette-from-image and then select to get 10 colors.
Additionally during making the wireframe I stumbled upon 2 colors which I used for the buttons and the text which are not in the color pallet. These are #FAF7F7 and the #4A3F46.

**Fonts & icons**

I used [Google Fonts]( https://fonts.google.com/)
The font I found in Adobe XD was Avenir, unfortunately this wasn’t a Google font, so I picked a similar one, Nunito.
