**Code Institute Milestone Project 1: User Centric Frontend Development**

<!-- <img src="/images/Homepage" alt="Follow the moon"/> -->

Follow the moon is a fictional site about living with the flow of the moon that I set up as my first milestone project. The focus with this site is to combine what I learned in a previous course about the moon with what I learned this far about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The site’s goal is to share information, tips and tricks about living with the flow of the moon.
